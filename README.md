## üéØ What This Calculator Does

This is **NOT** a full business model calculator. This is a **digital marketing command center** that helps dealership marketing teams:

- ‚úÖ **Calculate your Target CPL** based on profitability and funnel conversion rates
- ‚úÖ **Know instantly if you're overspending** with traffic-light color coding
- ‚úÖ **Reverse plan your budget** ("I need 50 sales ‚Üí What's my required budget?")
- ‚úÖ **Compare channel ROI** (Google vs. Meta vs. Cars.com vs. Autotrader)
- ‚úÖ **Model scenarios** ("What if I improve close rate by 5%?")

---

## üé≠ Who This Is For

**Marketing Directors at automotive dealerships** who need to:
- Track daily: Cost per lead, lead volume, conversion rates
- Answer weekly: "What's our cost per sale this month?"
- Plan monthly: "What budget do I need to hit 50 sales?"
- Optimize quarterly: "Which channel gives me the best ROI?"

**NOT for:**
- CFOs (use a full P&L model)
- Sales Managers (they focus on close rates, not ad spend)
- Service Managers (different revenue stream)

---

## üìä Key Metrics

### The Hero Metric: Target CPL

**Formula:**
```
Allowable Cost Per Sale = Gross Profit √ó Marketing %
Overall Conversion = Lead-to-Appt % √ó Show Rate % √ó Close Rate %
Target CPL = Allowable Cost Per Sale √ó Overall Conversion
```

**Example (Findlay Subaru Prescott defaults):**
- Gross Profit Per Sale: $4,800
- Acceptable Marketing Investment: 25%
- Allowable Cost Per Sale: $1,200
- Overall Conversion: 4.4% (28% √ó 68% √ó 23%)
- **Target CPL: $52.80**

### Status Indicators

- üü¢ **ON TARGET** - Current CPL ‚â§ Target CPL (room to spend more)
- üü° **CLOSE** - Current CPL 1-15% over target (minor optimization)
- üî¥ **OVERSPENDING** - Current CPL >15% over target (major optimization needed)

## üéì Why This Design?

### The Problem with the Old Calculator

The original calculator tried to be a **full business model**:
- 15+ input fields across 4 tabs
- Tax rates, invoice costs, vehicle pricing
- Repeat purchase rates, service LTV, customer lifetime profit
- LTV:CAC ratios, payback periods, contribution margins
- E-commerce concepts applied to lead-gen business

**Result:** Marketing directors ignored 90% of it.

### The Solution: Roleplay-Driven Design

We roleplayed as Sarah Martinez, Marketing Director at Findlay Subaru Prescott:

**Her Daily Questions:**
- "What's my target CPL?" ‚Üí Giant hero section
- "Am I overspending?" ‚Üí Color-coded status
- "What budget for 50 sales?" ‚Üí Reverse planner
- "Which channel is best ROI?" ‚Üí Channel comparison

**What She Doesn't Care About:**
- Tax rates (accounting's job)
- Invoice costs (GM's territory)
- Customer LTV 7 years out (focused on THIS quarter)
- Repeat purchases (won't be at dealership in 5-7 years)
- Service revenue (different P&L)

**Result:** Calculator she'll actually use daily.
