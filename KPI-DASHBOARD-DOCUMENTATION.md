## Data Flow & Calculations

### 1. Base Persona Data
The dashboard uses the **Blended Overall Average** persona from the CAC calculator:

```javascript
const personaMetrics = {
    aov: 370,                   // Average Order Value
    returnRate: 4,              // Return rate %
    cosPercent: 55,             // Cost of Sales %
    fulfillmentCost: 36,        // Per order fulfillment
    gaPercent: 13,              // G&A overhead %
    returningCustomers: 27,     // % who return
    repeatOrderRate: 1.7,       // Additional orders from returning customers
    targetNetMargin: 10         // Target net profit margin %
}
```

### 2. Core Calculations (Matching CAC Calculator)

#### Step 1: AOV Post-Tax/Returns
```javascript
aovPostTax = AOV × (1 - returnRate/100)
// $3,500 × 0.985 = $3,447.50
```

#### Step 2: Contribution Margin
```javascript
contributionMargin = aovPostTax × (1 - cosPercent/100) - fulfillmentCost
// $3,447.50 × 0.525 - $200 = $1,609.94
contributionMarginPercent = (contributionMargin / aovPostTax) × 100
// 46.7%
```

#### Step 3: Operating Profit
```javascript
operatingProfit = aovPostTax × (1 - cosPercent/100 - gaPercent/100) - fulfillmentCost
// $3,447.50 × 0.415 - $200 = $1,230.71
```

#### Step 4: Customer Lifetime Metrics
```javascript
avgOrders = 1 + (returningCustomers/100 × repeatOrderRate)
// 1 + (0.30 × 1.5) = 1.45 orders

CLTV = aovPostTax × avgOrders
// $3,447.50 × 1.45 = $4,998.88

lifetimeProfit = operatingProfit × avgOrders
// $1,230.71 × 1.45 = $1,784.53
```

#### Step 5: CAC Calculations
```javascript
profitDrivenCAC = lifetimeProfit - (CLTV × targetNetMargin/100)
// $1,784.53 - ($4,998.88 × 0.16) = $984.71

targetROAS = aovPostTax / profitDrivenCAC
// $3,447.50 / $984.71 = 3.5x

ltvCacRatio = CLTV / profitDrivenCAC
// $4,998.88 / $984.71 = 5.08x
```

### 3. Marketing Bridge Metrics (New)

#### Lead Conversion Rate
```javascript
conversionRate = Orders ÷ Leads
// Example: 125 orders ÷ 3,125 leads = 4.0%
```

#### Cost Per Lead
```javascript
CPL = Marketing Spend ÷ Leads
// Example: $123,088 ÷ 3,125 = $39.38
```

### 4. Monthly Variations
The dashboard adds realistic monthly fluctuations:

```javascript
// Seasonal CAC variation (±15%)
seasonalFactor = 1 + (0.15 × sin((month - 3) × π / 6))

// Random market variation (±10%)
marketVariation = 0.9 + (random() × 0.2)

monthlyCAC = baseCACÂ × seasonalFactor × marketVariation
```

## Integration with CAC Calculator

### Shared Mathematical Foundation
Both tools use identical formulas, ensuring consistency:

| Metric | CAC Calculator | KPI Dashboard | Verified Match |
|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| AOV (Post-Tax/Returns) | $3,447.50 | $3,447.50 | ✅ |
| Contribution Margin | 46.7% | 46.7% | ✅ |
| Profit-Driven CAC | $985 | $985 | ✅ |
| Target ROAS | 3.5x | 3.5x | ✅ |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | 5.08x | 5.08x | ✅ |

   - Return on Ad Spend target
   - For every $1 spent, generate $3.50 in revenue

4. **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 5.08x
   - Customer lifetime value vs. acquisition cost
   - Healthy ratio is >3x (this is excellent at 5.08x)

5. **Annual Revenue**: $4.69M
   - Total revenue from 1,455 orders
   - Based on $3,500 AOV

6. **Total Orders**: 1,455
   - Annual order volume
   - Growing 22% year-over-year

7. **Lead → Order Conversion**: 4.2%
   - Percentage of leads that become customers
   - Key efficiency metric

8. **Cost per Lead (CPL)**: $41
   - Marketing spend per lead generated
   - Top-of-funnel efficiency indicator

## How to Use in Sales Calls

### Opening Script
> "Let me show you what your performance dashboard could look like. This uses your exact business model - the automotive dealership industry with $370 average orders..."

### Key Talking Points

1. **CAC Context**
   - "Notice how your CAC of $985 means you can spend up to that amount and still hit your 16% margin target"
   - "The monthly variation shows why tracking matters - Q1 is always more expensive"

2. **Marketing Bridge**
   - "See how your 4.2% conversion rate and $41 CPL combine to create that $985 CAC"
   - "Improving conversion by just 0.5% drops your CAC by $100+"

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - "The seasonal patterns help you plan budgets - expect 15% higher costs in January"
   - "Your LTV:CAC ratio of 5x is exceptional - industry standard is 3x"

4. **Action Items**
   - "With this visibility, you could optimize spend timing"
   - "The data suggests increasing Q4 investment when conversion peaks"

### Objection Handling

**"Our business is different"**
> "Absolutely - that's why we have four different personas. Let me show you the Design-Forward Professional version with $430 orders and 11% margins..."

**"This seems complex"**
> "The beauty is that once set up, it's automatic. You just need to track orders and marketing spend - the calculations happen instantly."

**"What's the ROI of tracking this?"**
> "Clients typically reduce CAC by 15-20% in the first year through optimization. On your $4.7M revenue, that's $70-90K in additional profit."

## Customization Guide

### Changing the Persona
To switch from Blended Average to another persona:

1. Update `personaMetrics` object:
```javascript
// Example: Design-Forward Professional
const personaMetrics = {
    aov: 430,
    returnRate: 4,
    cosPercent: 53,
    fulfillmentCost: 38,
    gaPercent: 14,
    returningCustomers: 30,
    repeatOrderRate: 1.8,
    targetNetMargin: 11
}
```

2. Update monthly data:
```javascript
// Adjust order volumes and revenue
orders: [40, 42, 48, 48, 50, 46, 44, 44, 50, 54, 56, 60],
revenue: [340000, 357000, 408000, 408000, 425000, 391000, 374000, 374000, 425000, 459000, 476000, 510000]
```

### Adding New Metrics
To add a custom KPI:

1. Add to KPI summary:
```html
<div class="kpi-card">
    <div class="kpi-label">Your Metric</div>
    <div class="kpi-value" id="yourMetric">0</div>
    <div class="kpi-change positive">
        <span>↑</span> Change
    </div>
</div>
```

2. Calculate in JavaScript:
```javascript
const yourMetric = // your calculation
document.getElementById('yourMetric').textContent = yourMetric;
```

### Modifying Variations
Adjust seasonal patterns:
```javascript
// Current: ±15% seasonal, ±10% random
// To make more stable (±5% seasonal, ±5% random):
const seasonalFactor = 1 + (0.05 * Math.sin((i - 3) * Math.PI / 6));
const monthlyCAC = profitDrivenCAC * seasonalFactor * (0.95 + Math.random() * 0.1);
```
